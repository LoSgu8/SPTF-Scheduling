# [Traffic Theory] SPTF-Scheduling Project
Politecnico di Milano - Traffic Theory Final Project 2021
Developed with OMNet++

Implement a	M/G/1	system with	an	SPTF	discipline where G	is	Uniform(0,L)
All	input	parameters	must	be	NED	parameters	in	omnetpp.ini
Collect statistics on:
- Average general and	conditional queuing time
- Average response time
- Utilization of	the	server
- Queue	length over	time
Compare experimental and	theoretical values of:
- Average conditional queueing time
- Average response time
- Utilization factor of	the	server

Statistics .csv file can be found on results/ folder.
